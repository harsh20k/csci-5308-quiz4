# This is the quiz 4.
n this exercise, you are developing a task management system partially for a distributed team collaboration platform. The system supports complex task tracking, prioritization, and resource allocation. Please use Java as your programming language. It is an open exercise i.e., you may use online available resources except generative AI tools and platforms. You may use any IDE but without generative models (such Copilot). Another constraint is that you cannot discuss or take help from another person.

## Requirements

1. Use TDD approach with 100% code coverage to develop the following requirements.

2. You need to implement a Task abstraction implementing a set of functionalities. Specifically, create a Task class with at least following methods:
    - assignTo(team_member): Assign a task to a specific team member
    - updateStatus(new_status): Change task status with validation
    - isOverdue(): Determine if task is past its estimated completion time

3. You may create additional classes/abstractions to fulfill the above requirements. Make reasonable assumptions if any information seem missing.

4. Create a public repository on GitLab or GitHub for your code. Follow best practices for your git repository. Your TDD approach and incremental development must reflect from the commit history. Please ensure to paste the link of the repository as the response to this question and ensure we have access to the repository at least for next two weeks; without it we wont be able to evaluate the quiz and you will get zero.
